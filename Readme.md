# Stock Management System

## A simple stock management simulator made in Python.

I made it as a beginner project to impliment the OOP (Object Oriented Programming) concept.

***

## Overview:

Every player has 1000 credits in the beginning. They can buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them at a higher rate when the prices are high, just like real stock market.

There is no persistent data, so every time you start from the beginning. I will be adding persistence system and fixing some known bugs in future updates.


## Requirements:

Requires Python installed in your system.

## For linux systems :
**change** ``os.system('cls')`` to ``os.system('clear')``

## Version: 1.0.1
## Older Versions: None
